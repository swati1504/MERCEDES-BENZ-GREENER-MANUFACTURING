## MERCEDES-BENZ-GREENER-MANUFACTURING

You are required to reduce the time that cars spend on the test bench. You will work with a dataset representing different permutations of features in a Mercedes-Benz car to predict the time it takes to pass testing. Optimal algorithms will contribute to faster testing, resulting in lower carbon dioxide emissions without reducing Daimlerâ€™s standards.

Step1: Import the required libraries

Step2: Load the data 

Step4: Understand the data we have and setting the target variable

Step 5: Remove columns ID and Y from the data as they are not used for learning

Step 6: Check for null and unique values for test and train sets 

Step 7: Remove columns whose variance is 0

Step8: EDA - Integer Column Analysis, Apply label encoder

Step9: Baseline model -  RandomForest Regressor model

Step10: Perform dimensionality reduction using PCA

Step11: Training using xgboost

Step12: Predict your test_df values using xgboost

The r2_score is 0.45 and rmse values is 9.36
